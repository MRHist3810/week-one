* Could not decipher the instructions on the syllabus at all. Fled to Google for answers.

* Instead, I followed instructions at this link: https://www.thewindowsclub.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-from-right-click-menu

* Got a command prompt open and entered the code. Error ensued.

**How to resolve an unrecognized command?**

I've been trying to import a command and when I do I am met with a message saying that the command isn't recognized. It seems simple enough, so I'm not sure where I'm going wrong.

The code is as follows:

> git commit -m "this is just a test"

And the error code:

> C:\Users\Matthew>git commit -m "this is just a test"

> 'git' is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.

Any ideas on where I've gone wrong?
