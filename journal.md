It probably would have been useful for me to have listened to the podcasts before anything else.

Starting off this week's work (and the class) in general was quite hard for me. On multiple occassions I opened the syllabus, looked around, got intimidated, and left it at that. Yesterday (May 8th) I sat down and pushed through my anxieties and worked my way through the steps.

Today (May 9th) I decided to tackle the readings and the audio components. Of course, my fears and anxieties about my inability to do this type of work is precisely what was discussed in the second podcast. They were useful to hear, just in the wrong order. Now I know for the future. I feel like those words might come up again throughout the course. I have a hard time addressing failure and asking for help, so it will be interesting to keep this introduction in mind.

One thing in particular I'm going to note here--in hopes that I can hold myself accountable--is to make better use of the Discord in this regard. We're at the end of the week and I've not really utilized it. Seeing now the emphasis on communal productivity, I hope I can push myself to step beyond my own comfort zone and get engaged.

Discussions brought up in the podcasts and readings about privilege are interesting to me. It's something that I evidently have, but that I was never really taught to consider or analyse growing up, or in school. I've found developing an understanding of this at university quite interesting, so I always appreciate coming across course material that brings it to the forefront.

(I left my journal here and decided to take a gamble and test Github's functionality. I wasn't done writing, but I wanted to see if I could stop and start writing when I felt like it, so I 'commited changes' and left it for the night. Today (May 10th) I've picked up where I left off and found that you can edit your work here just like any other Word or Google doc. Good to know.)

If I had to sum up Week one in a single word, it would be 'intimidating.' This is uncharted waters for me. I took this course because I met with you (Dr. Graham) just once for a meeting last year, and looked into your work and classes as a result. Your approach to this field of history drew me in, so I decided to give it a go.

Starting Week One was hard for me, I kept putting it off because of how foreign it all felt. However, I am slowly settling into this, know some things to tackle differently for next week, and I am excited to see where it all leads. I have been trying to push out of my historical comfort zones, so I hope to come away from all of this feeling somewhat accomplished in my efforts, and that my horizons have been expanded.
