It probably would have been useful for me to have listened to the podcasts before anything else.

Starting off this week's work (and the class) in general was quite hard for me. On multiple occassions I opened the syllabus, looked around, got intimidated, and left it at that. Yesterday (May 8th) I sat down and pushed through my anxieties and worked my way through the steps.

Today (May 9th) I decided to tackle the readings and the audio components. Of course, my fears and anxieties about my inability to do this type of work is precisely what was discussed in the second podcast. They were useful to hear, just in the wrong order. Now I know for the future. I feel like those words might come up again throughout the course. I have a hard time addressing failure and asking for help, so it will be interesting to keep this introduction in mind.

One thing in particular I'm going to note here--in hopes that I can hold myself accountable--is to make better use of the Discord in this regard. We're at the end of the week and I've not really utilized it. Seeing now the emphasis on communal productivity, I hope I can push myself to step beyond my own comfort zone and get engaged.

Discussions brought up in the podcasts and readings about privilege are interesting to me. It's something that I evidently have, but that I was never really taught to consider or analyse growing up, or in school. I've found developing an understanding of this at university quite interesting, so I always appreciate coming across course material that brings it to the forefront.
